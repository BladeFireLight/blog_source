  hi program only half works - I try to use it on UFOUD and the game is still
  reverting to beginner level after a few saves and reloads, although the other
  features remain. Also, the command line prompt will constantly say invalid
  flag inside or outside combat, when I'm trying manually to increase game
  difficulty back to a normal level, making it impossible to edit the game in a
  meaningful way. What am I doing wrong? I'm trying editor on both tactical and
  geoscape saves (two different games) but can't get it to work, and nobody has
  done a youtube or basic instructive article on how to work the program. I even
  needed to use a third party site to see how to enter the commands on DOSBox as
  those contained in the util text file are not "dumb" enough to allow for those
  with little programming skill......thanks btw if you get back to me. I'm
  playing version one of the game, in Russian.....
