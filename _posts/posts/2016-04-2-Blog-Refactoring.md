## Sometimes rebooting fixes everything

After spending month after month on WidnowsImageTools and little else in my freetime. My blog has been looking like abandonware. I had always planed to comback, but there was always this naging issue. WordPress. is a hosted service and cost money if you want more then the vanila. And I had no intrest in hosting WordPress elseware. It also was missing a plugin that alowed you to to referance GitHub files directly. Copying code from a GitHub project into Gist seems like a major waste of time.

## Enter Jeklle

About a month ago I listened to a podcast where they breefly mentinoed github pages. This perked my istrest. Partialy because if was free, and partly because if was GitHub. (I also like the idea of bloging like a hacker). 

I figured if it was hosted on GitHub, surely they would have a easy way to referance a GitHub Repo. No such luck. The default plugins were somehwat limited. If I wanted unsuported plugins I had to compile the site localy. So I looked at all the plugins for Jeklle in Ruby Gems, I came accross one that worked. However it only wanted to work in Jeklle version 1. I looked at the code on it's GitHub repo and it looked to be an arbatrary requirement. So I set out the setup Jeklle on windows. 

I plan to write a full blog on the expiance. There were many bumps and gatcha's getting here, but I now can reference sections of GitHub Repos files in my posts, so it was worth it.

## The future.

I'm sittnig in the airpot wating to head off to the PowerShell and DevOps Summit. I hope of have this blog launced, and material for some more posts, up and running before the week is out.
